# travel_expense_manager
This is my second project in Javascript. A travel expense manager, just using variables, expressions, statements, string, conditionals and iterations.


My motivation for creating this project was to manage my budget more effectively when travelling. I wanted to improve my programming skills in JavaScript and it was a good exercise to do so. I also wanted to make it easier to track expenses while travelling.


I created this project, called 'A Travel Expense Manager', to help myself and others manage expenses while travelling more efficiently. I wanted to provide a practical and customisable solution for tracking expenses.

How it works:
- At the beginning, the user enters the number of days of the trip and the total budget available.
- Next, the user can enter the categories of expenses (such as accommodation, food, transport, etc.).
- For each category, the user can enter the daily expenditure, specifying the amount and changing it if necessary.
- At the end of the trip, the programme calculates the total expenditure for each category and the total budget used.
- Finally, a message is displayed indicating whether the budget has been met or exceeded.



During this project I learnt how to use variables, expressions, statements, strings, conditions and iterations in JavaScript. I also improved my organisational and information management skills.
